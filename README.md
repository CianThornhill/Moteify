## Introduction

Moteify is an emote sharing platform where artists can upload and share their creations for others to favourite and download, for use with emote supporting sites and platforms such as Twitch and Discord.

The project was developed as part of Code Institute's 16 week Full Stack Development course as my final individual capstone project, bringing together the knowledge I've learned over the course of my study.

The project focuses on the use of Django and Bootstrap frameworks to aid in the production of a functional web app with database manipulation and CRUD functionality.

## Project Overview

Moteify was designed as a way to allow artists to upload their emote creations for download and use online by others on various emote supporting platforms.

The idea was to create a site that fufills the educational project purposes of implementing CRUD functionality in a short project completion window of 2 weeks, while retaining a relevant business use case.

In this regard, rather than a fully functioning emote marketplace, Moteify aims to serve as an emote **sharing platform** which enables artists to upload, favourite and view other artists emote creations to a publically available space, allowing user's to download their creations and share them with friends and implement them on their own emote supported streams and servers.

User's of Moteify can:

- Register, log in and log out.
  - _(Log in is Required to favourite and upload emotes)._
- Upload Emotes
  - _(Emote aspect ratio is locked to ensure compatibility for use on apps such as Discord and Twitch. size lock for site display purposes)._
- Favourite Emotes
  - _Users can favourite emotes they find that they like for future reference and to more easily find them within their favourites list._
- Search for Emotes by category:
  - _Emotes are assigned categories when uploaded, allowing users to filter for specific emotions._
- Create their User Profile
  - _(Future implementations planned to allow users to view other user profiles, enabling artists to share their portfolios etc.)._
- Manage their emotes, favourites and User Profile.
  - _Full CRUD functionality has been implemented to allow users to edit, and delete uploaded emotes or their account as a whole._
